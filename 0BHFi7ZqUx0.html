<h2>Community Code of Conduct OpenStreetMap</h2><p><b>總則</b></p><p>善待彼此。</p><p><b>Be Considerate</b></p><p></p><ul class="code"><li>General</li>
<li>Be nice to each other.</li>
<li>Be Considerate</li>
<li>Work created by OpenStreetMap is seen by people around the world and&nbsp;</li>
<li>by contributing to the project, you&rsquo;re representing not only yourself,&nbsp;</li>
<li>but OpenStreetMap itself. Please keep that in mind with your words and&nbsp;</li>
<li>actions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Be Respectful</li>
<li>OpenStreetMap contributors come from a variety of backgrounds and&nbsp;</li>
<li>have a variety of skill sets. We believe that our diversity is a source&nbsp;</li>
<li>of strength and that everyone has something to contribute to the&nbsp;</li>
<li>project. Some degree of frustration and constructive disagreement is to&nbsp;</li>
<li>be expected when dealing with a passionate community project. However,&nbsp;</li>
<li>it is important to remember that a community where people feel&nbsp;</li>
<li>uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. In the spirit of&nbsp;</li>
<li>collaboration, please refrain from allowing healthy differences of&nbsp;</li>
<li>opinion or frustration to turn into personal attacks or flame/edit wars.</li>
<li>&nbsp; . We expect members of the OpenStreetMap community to be respectful&nbsp;</li>
<li>when dealing with other contributors, as well as people outside the&nbsp;</li>
<li>project.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Be Collaborative</li>
<li>Collaboration is central to OpenStreetMap. OSM encourages members to&nbsp;</li>
<li>work together both inside and outside the organization. Collaboration,&nbsp;</li>
<li>internally and externally,&nbsp; strengthens our community. OSM members are&nbsp;</li>
<li>encouraged to act transparently and when possible involve all interested</li>
<li>&nbsp;parties. When a new approach is taken on an existing project or a major</li>
<li>&nbsp;project is considered/started, please notify the larger community&nbsp;</li>
<li>early, document the work and inform others regularly of progress.</li>
<li>When we disagree, we consult others</li>
<li>Disagreements, both social and technical, are common in diverse&nbsp;</li>
<li>communities. It is crucial for the long term success of the project that</li>
<li>&nbsp;major disagreements are resolved constructively, with transparency,&nbsp;</li>
<li>with the help of the community and community processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>When we are unsure, we ask for help</li>
<li>Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in the&nbsp;</li>
<li>OpenStreetMap community. Asking questions before taking a major action&nbsp;</li>
<li>can prevent problems down the road, and so questions are encouraged.&nbsp;</li>
<li>When asking a question, members are encouraged to do so in an open and&nbsp;</li>
<li>appropriate forum.</li>
<li>Step down considerately</li>
<li>When members of OSM leave or disengage from the project and/or&nbsp;</li>
<li>community, they are asked to do so in a way that minimizes disruption to</li>
<li>&nbsp;the project as a whole. Members are strongly encouraged to put forth an</li>
<li>&nbsp;effort to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.</li>
<li>Respect Copyright and Licenses</li>
<li>Please be conscious of license issues, and never add data in a way&nbsp;</li>
<li>that violates other licenses or copyright. While this is primarily a&nbsp;</li>
<li>concern for OpenStreetMap data edits, remember that pasting data or&nbsp;</li>
<li>images into a mailing list, or wiki page can also be a violation of&nbsp;</li>
<li>copyright. Remember to comply with any attribution and share-alike&nbsp;</li>
<li>requirements of any images/data placed on these channels, and avoid&nbsp;</li>
<li>placing closed-license content there.</li>
<li><br/></li></ul>
